# WorldPopulation

This is a simple .NET console application created as an exercise for studying and practicing the fundamentals of collections in C#. The exercise was proposed in Pluralsight's [Beginning C# Collections](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/csharp-collections-beginning) course, by Simon Robinson, and I tried to merge the different concepts taught in the course into a single application.

Some of the topics covered are:

- Arrays
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Importing from a CSV data source
- Query data using foreach and for loops
- Manipulation of list data
